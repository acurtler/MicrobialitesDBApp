# Microbialites Database App  

https://microbialites.stthomas.edu  

The code for the microbialites database app is part of a private repository for security reasons as this is an ongoing research project and the web application is still in development. 

This project was made possible in part by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program at UST. This project was part of a research job with a geology professor and two other computer science students. The professor had an extensive database on microbialites, which are rocks that formed under the influence of microbes, hosted in Microsoft Access. In accordance with the NSF's efforts to increase open access to scientific data, the professor wished to move his data to an open access platform. The other two students worked on the back-end of this project by migrating the data to PostgreSQL and defining the database structure. I worked on developing the web application so that the microbialite data can be accessed by all in the scientific community. I created web pages using CSS, HTML, Node.js, Express.js, and javaScript. I wrote APIs to query the database and display results on the web page. We also set up a St. Thomas affiliated web domain for the website. 

The project is still in development as other student researchers will take over the building of the web app, making the data exploration functionality more robust. Eventually, there will be GIS mapping implementation and different user types with login credentials so that researchers can add their microbialite data to the database.
